// shared.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class SharedService {
  private messageSource = new BehaviorSubject<string>('default data'); // Initialize with empty string or default
  currentMessage = this.messageSource.asObservable();

  changeMessage(message: string) {
    this.messageSource.next(message);
  }
}

// The line currentMessage = this.messageSource.asObservable(); is crucial for encapsulating the behavior of the BehaviorSubject
// (messageSource) and exposing it as a read-only observable stream. Here's a breakdown of why this is done:

// Key Reasons
// Encapsulation: By exposing messageSource as currentMessage via .asObservable(), we're providing a public, read-only access point.'
// This allows components to subscribe to changes in messageSource but prevents them from directly modifying it, maintaining better
// control over the data flow.

// Separation of Concerns: messageSource itself is of type BehaviorSubject, which has both next() (to emit new values)
// and subscribe() (to listen to values) methods. However, only the SharedService should have control over when new values are emitted,
// while other components should only be able to subscribe. Exposing only the observable (currentMessage) reinforces this separation.

// Consistent Subscription Interface: Observables are a standard way in Angular to handle asynchronous data streams. 
//Using .asObservable() provides a consistent interface for components to subscribe to, aligning with best practices in Angular
// for data flow management.

// ----------------------------

// We could directly use an observable instead of a BehaviorSubject, but BehaviorSubject has specific advantages, 
//particularly for this use case in Angular. Here’s why BehaviorSubject is often preferred:

// 1. Immediate Access to the Latest Value
// A BehaviorSubject stores the latest value, so when a new subscriber joins, it immediately receives the current value.
// This is particularly useful for sibling communication, where you want a component to get the latest data upon subscription,
// even if it wasn’t actively listening when the data was initially emitted.

// Without BehaviorSubject: If you use a plain Observable, subscribers won’t have access to the previous value. They would only
/// get data from future emissions, potentially missing earlier updates. This can cause issues where a component subscribes late
// and doesn’t receive an initial value.

// 2. Default or Initial Value
// BehaviorSubject requires an initial value when instantiated. This is useful because you can set a default value that subscribers
// will receive before any other data is emitted. This is helpful for providing a starting point, like showing an empty message or
// a loading state, even if no data has been provided yet.

// 3. Updating and Emitting New Values
// BehaviorSubject allows us to both emit and listen to data using next(), unlike a regular Observable, which is read-only.
// This write capability (next()) is necessary if you want the service itself to update and push new data to all subscribers.
// Without it, you’d need a different mechanism (e.g., creating a new observable each time data changes).

// When a Regular Observable Might Be Suitable
// If you only need to broadcast events without holding onto the latest state or providing a default value, a regular Observable
// might work. For example:

// For events like button clicks or notifications, where the latest state isn’t as important.
// In this sibling communication scenario, though, BehaviorSubject is usually the best fit because it provides state management,
// ensures up-to-date values for new subscribers, and supports both reading and writing data efficiently.
